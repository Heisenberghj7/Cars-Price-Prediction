- ðŸŽ¯ **`Business Goal`** : We are required in this **`notebook`** to **model the price of cars with the available independent variables**. It will be used by the users or  related car companies to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly understand what factors play for the value of the cars, the business strategy, etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
